This is the secodn section of the course.
## Intro to JavaScript
it has four topics: 
1. Varaiables and Data Types
2. Functions and Methods
3. Making Decisions with JavaScript
4. Arrays and Loops

### Varaiables and Data Types
this section explains about the data types of Javascript. There are 7 data types in JavaScript.
1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined
6. Symbol
7. Object

there are constant varaiables. that doesnt change the value 
there is a var and let keywords to declare the varaiables. you do not specify the data type of the varaiable. it is automatically determined by the value assigned to it.

`var` can be called before it is declared. `let` **cannot** be called before it is declared.

*arithmetic operators* and *string formatting* works quote the same as in python.

I liked the [exercises](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/) they provided about Javascript, and i found it useful.
