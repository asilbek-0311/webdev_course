## 1. intro to html
there we have created the basic html structure for our terrarium.
there was an interesting [video](https://youtu.be/OUDV1gqs9GA) shows how screen readers are used and hte importance oof accessibility in the html code.

and there was a link to the deprecated html tags and elements [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#obsolete_and_deprecated_elements)

## 2. intro to css
this section was about the css and how to style the terrarium. there were a lot of elements and properties used in the css file. there are a lot of properties that can be used for the css selectors. 

## 3. intro to DOM and JS closures
This section itroduced the DOM and JS closures.
what i understood was the DOM is hte structore of the html, and there are was to maipulate, like accessing the specific emelemtns in the body of the html. MDN has a good documentation on the DOM [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
JS closures is a bit confucing concept. what i understood was it is a scope that is created when a function is created. and it enables to access the local varaibles of the function. MDN has a good documentation on the JS closures [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)
