# This is the 5th chapter of the webdev course

i am gonna build a simpel browser extention on this chapter.  

This extension, which is like a mini web site that is tailored to a very specific task, checks the C02 Signal API for a given region's electricity usage and carbon intensity, and returns a reading on the region's carbon footprint.

This module includes lessons on how browsers work and how to deploy a browser extension, how to build a form, call an API, and use local storage, and how to gauge the performance of your website and improve it.

This module has three sections:
1. How Browsers Work
2. Forms and Local Storage
3. Background tasks and Performance

## How Browsers Work

I have finished the extension and it is working fine. I have also learned about local storage and how to use it. I have also learned about npm and node. I have also learned how to upload the extension to the browser and how to test it locally.
Browser extension is actually a mini website that will be doingt eh work constantly in the background. It is a very useful tool to have. I will be using it in the future as well. i willt ry to build simple extension to improve my skills on using APIs.
