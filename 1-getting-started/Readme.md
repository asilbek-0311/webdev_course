This section will cover the basics of programming languages. neccessary tools and development environtment. I relly liked the recources they provided. the MDN documentation is really helpful and it is a great place to start.

## Github basics
This section will cover the basics of github. how to create a repository, how to clone it, how to push and pull changes.
I really liked the part where they explained abotu branches and pull requests. it is a great way to collaborate with others. Also, they explained how to contribute to open source projects, and provided necessary links to get started.
Here is a link for [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution)
