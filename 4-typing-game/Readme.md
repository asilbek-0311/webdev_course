This is the 4th chapter of the webdev course

in this chapter we will create a typing game using html css and javascript

I have created a simple typeing game, that allows users to type the words shown on the screen. it highlights the next words that should be typed. it also shows the amoun of time spend to finish the quote.

it is a simple game, but it was  agood paractice to learn more about DOM manipulation and event listeners. And also, i ahev spent good amount of time for CSS. it was a good practise to improve my css as well.

i had a bug in highlighting the next word. i was using childNodes in creating the words of the quote. but it was not working properly. i have fixed the bug by using children instead of childNodes. So i can access all the words in the quote and highlight the next word.

i will be adding mroe fetures and fixing the bugs in future.

Also, if you guys would like to play the game, you cna clone the repository and open the index.html file in the browser. I do not want to deploy since it is too simple and not worth deploying yet, maybe later once i imporve the game.
