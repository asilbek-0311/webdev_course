This is the 4th chapter of the webdev course

in this chapter we will create a typing game using html css and javascript

I have created a simple typeing game, that allows users to type the words shown on the screen. it highlights the next words that should be typed. it also shows the amoun of time spend to finish the quote.

it is a simple game, but it was  agood paractice to learn more about DOM manipulation and event listeners. And also, i ahev spent good amount of time for CSS. it was a good practise to improve my css as well.

i will be adding mroe fetures and fixing the bugs in fture.
